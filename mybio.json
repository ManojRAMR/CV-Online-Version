After working there for a few months, I realized that I was much more passionate for my side hustle as a web developer rather than a mold development engineer. The idea was strong enough for me to switch my career pursue from a mechanical engineer to be a web developer. I do believe this decision would bring the best in me.","Currently, I am working in a Swedish-American startup as a web developer on contract basis. My current stack is HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, & MySQL. Also, currently learning React and intend to learn React Native soon. My focus is building a career as a full stack developer while being up-to-date with new technologies."]
